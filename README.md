# Hostel Student Monitoring and Outpass Management System

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to streamline the process of monitoring students in a hostel and managing outpass requests. It replaces the traditional paper-based workflow with a digital solution, improving efficiency and security.

## Features

- **Student Module**: Students can log in to the system and request an outpass from the warden. Once the request is made, it is sent to the warden for approval.
- **Warden Module**: Wardens can review the outpass requests, check the student's information, and either approve or reject the request. Approved requests generate a unique QR code.
- **QR Code Generation**: Upon approval, a unique QR code is generated for each outpass, which students can use at the hostel gate. This eliminates the need for physical forms and reduces wait time.
- **Staff Module**: Gate security staff can scan the QR code to quickly verify the student's outpass status, ensuring a smooth and secure exit process.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (or any MongoDB instance)
- **Additional Libraries**: QR Code generation libraries, Express.js middleware, and Mongoose for MongoDB interaction.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student-outpass-project.git
   cd hostel-outpass-system

2.**Install Dependencies:**

Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories and run the following command to install necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```
## Running the Application

The application requires two terminals to run both the frontend and backend servers:

### Backend Server

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory, then start the server:

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```
### Frontend Server
Open another terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Configuration
The application must be connected to a MongoDB database for storing and retrieving historical data. You can configure the MongoDB connection string in the backend's configuration file (config.js or similar).

Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance running. Update the database connection URI as needed.

### Usage
**Students:** Log in, fill in the outpass request form, and submit. Check the status of the request through the dashboard.
**Wardens:** Review incoming outpass requests, approve or reject them. Upon approval, a QR code will be generated.
**Gate Security:** Scan the QR code to validate the student's outpass for secure and authorized exits.

### Features
-You will get notification based on the status of approval or deny.
-You can contact responsible staff via this app admin can store staff contact.
-You can access in mobile phone as well.
